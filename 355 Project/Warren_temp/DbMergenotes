Used export of dbvisualizer to output my tables into a file "olddb.sql", then imported it into my own schema in the central db in dbvisualizer.
--From there, it was all simple copy operations

--Basically all the other inserts were like this, no changes

--I couldn't cast my workcreationyear values into the central database properly, I added them in by hand with
--UPDATES.
